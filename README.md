#üîß API and Data
TMDb API
The application uses the TMDb API to fetch movie posters. You can get your own API key by signing up on The Movie Database.

The API key is stored in the code as:
```python
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&language=en-US"
```
# üë©‚Äçüíª How the App Works
Movie Selection: Users can select a movie from the dropdown list, which contains titles of movies from the dataset.
Recommendation: Once a movie is selected and the "Show Recommendation" button is clicked, the app fetches 5 similar movies using a precomputed similarity matrix.
Display: The titles and posters of the recommended movies are displayed in a row.

#üîÆ Future Improvements
Add more data and enhance the recommendation system to use collaborative filtering.
Improve the user interface with additional features such as search and filters.
Add functionality for movie trailers and more detailed movie information.
